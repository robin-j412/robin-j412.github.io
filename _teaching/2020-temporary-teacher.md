My first teaching experiment at the university. The topic was _Graph Algorithms_. 

---
The goal was to introduced to second-year student some of the most important algorithm for graph, from the presentation to the implementation in Java: 
* Dijkstra,
* Bellman-Ford
* Warshall-Floyd
* Kruskal
* Prim
* Welsh-Powell

This lasts 52 hours over a period of 3 years. It was done during my PhD.
