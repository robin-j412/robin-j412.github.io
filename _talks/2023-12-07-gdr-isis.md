How to estimate evolution patterns from *satellite image time series* ? There are plenty of solution in the scientific literature, while few of them focus on decades-long evolutions of real value indicators. 

The experimentd presented here consist in comparing two *deep learning* models, on *nighttime light* evolution prediction, with *satellite image time series* One predicts *nighttime light* evolution sequentially, according to each image in the time serie, seen one by one. The other predicts the full evolution at once.

Three important results. (1) Short term (1-3 years) evolution are hard to estimate for both models. (2) Medium and long term (10 - 20 years) are better predition with the spatio-temporal model. (3) These results are obtained on a continetal-wide study area.
