### Abstract 

In  remote  sensing,  deep  spatio-temporal  models, _i.e._, deep  learning  models  that  estimate  information  based  on Satellite Image Time Series obtain successful results in Land Use/Land  Cover  classification  or  change  detection. Nevertheless, for socioeconomic applications such as poverty estimation, only deep spatial models have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a test-bed to compare spatial and spatio-temporal  paradigms  to  estimate  the  evolution  of  NighttimeLight (NTL), a standard proxy for socioeconomic indicators.We applied the test-bed in the area of Zanzibar, Tanzania for 21  years. We  observe  that  (1)  both  models  obtain  roughly equivalent performances when predicting the NTL value at a given time, but (2) the spatio-temporal model is significantly more efficient when predicting the evolution of NTL.
